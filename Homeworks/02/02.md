# Homework 02

Your first programming homework is to create a simple web page in plain HTML & CSS. How it looks is up to you and won't be graded, but I encourage you to make it at least a bit aesthetically pleasing.

There are 5 tasks, two of which are extra, in this homework. You must earn a passing grade on 3 basic tasks to complete the homework. To earn a passing grade on a task, your solution should reasonably complete the requirements in the task. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be reasonably okay.

Each task has a number of points to it, the points are there for our overview of the quality of your homeworks in the academy and have nothing to do with passing the task or not. You can pass with less than 50% on each task.

Basic tasks are as follows:

1. (5 points) The page should have a form which takes 3 inputs: an email, a password and a text sentence. Basically, something like a login form with an additional input. Something like [this](Facebook_login.png). The form should have a submit button, but it shouldn't do anything particular, just submit the data to "nowhere".
2. (5 points) On Desktop, the page should have a header (top menu) containing a few dummy buttons. The header should also contain your custom page logo. The page logo should also be created using only html and css (e.g. div element with background and border radius will create a circle) or svg, if you know what svg is and how to add it. The point is: It should not be an image. Play around if you want, or just make it simple, like a text in a box. If you need examples of header menu, check out [this website](https://elementor.com/blog/website-header-design/).
3. (5 points) On mobile, the desktop header should be hidden, but your page should have a bottom navigation similar to [this one](https://m2.material.io/components/bottom-navigation) or those on [mobile YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) or [mobile Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) versions.

Two additional tasks are closely related, you need to expand both menus:

1. (5 points) On desktop menu, you should add a button which expands additional menu which goes **over main the content of the page**. You can see an example of this on [Sofascore's](https://www.sofascore.com/) desktop web when you click [the settings button on the desktop version of the page](Sofascore_settings.png).
2. (5 points + 5 points) On mobile menu, you should add a button which expands additional menu over it. Depending on how you implement this, you can also add **intro** animation, if possible. An example of this you can find in YouTube mobile app, the (+) button in the middle of [bottom navigation](YouTubeMobile_closed.jpg) which opens an additional [bottom sheet](YouTubeMobile_open.jpg).

How to even complete additional tasks in plain HTML+CSS without JS or anything else? Check out how we used checkbox checked in positionTransition.html example from lecture 2.

# Requirements

All homeworks must be in the GitHub repository you have created for your first assignment. Each must be in its separate folder (naming e.g. hw02, homework2, ...). You must create a git branch for each homework, add your commits on that new branch, and once you have finished it, create a pull request and **add me as a reviewer**.

What is a pull request and how to create it:
- https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests
- https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

Estimated duration: 3 hours - 2 days, depending on how complex you want to make it
