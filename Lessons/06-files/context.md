Demonstrate how data can be passed via context by creating `MatchContext` which will provide data to child components instead of passing it via props.

Context should be declared inside `context` directory.

Provider should be in the same file in which Match details are fetched and the context shall be used in `MatchHeader.tsx` file which is inside `modules/Match` directory.
