Demonstrate how styled components are used in two examples:
- write a component called `Button` which is a styled `button` element
- write a component called `FancyButton` which is styled `Button` component

Both components should be inside `Button.tsx` file in `components` directory.

Use both `Button` and `FancyButton` components in your demo project.
