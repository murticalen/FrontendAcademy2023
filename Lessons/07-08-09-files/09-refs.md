Example: `Refs.tsx`

Show how refs work by placing it on a div. Using the refrence, you should set the width of the div in a state in useEffect.

Try playing around with your window width and show that ref change doesn't re-render the component even though it is now smaller/bigger. Then refresh the page using `F5` and see a different number.
